It wasn’t installed properly and not easy to fix. They magically fix sections as they become problematic, which most roofers would upsell you. But they do it because they want to do what is best for the client. Not create huge projects when things can be repaired. I have used Jason, German, and company twice a year to come inspect and repair sections of my roof (to prolong its longevity). I have also used them to treat/clean my roof. I’m shocked at how brand new it looks and they do it gently/with care. Their work is excellent/detailed and their pricing is very good. They also replaced/painted all of the trim and fascia on the exterior of my house, as well as many interior projects (repairing walls where I had a leak, painting (to perfection!!!), carpentry, chimney repair, cabinet updates, and power washing.
