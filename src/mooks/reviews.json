        "description": "I had a roof leak for a while. After dealing with multiple roof companies it was a challenge to get them to do the job. I contacted Jeison and he was able to squeeze me in to get the roof replaced. His guys were extremely thorough replacing the wood roof along with the copper flashing. They took their time and did it the right way. I then hired them to install an interior French door and again squeezed me in the get it done. I would definitely recommend GA Castro for home improvements. Thank you Jeison.",

They fabricated and repaired the aluminum around my home and covered the gaps in my siding and took additional care to ensure it all matched. They were easy to get in touch with and reviewed all the work in person afterword. I'd gladly call them again for any roofing needs!",

Thankfully I got recommended to the experts at G.A Castro and they were able to completely replace my roof with warranty as well as fixing all the underlying issues from my leaking roof for the price of my deductible. Thanks to them I was able to get these issues resolved and thanks to their dedication to professionalism and transparency with the customer I had the peace of mind knowing that the work was going to get done by knowledgeable professionals.",

We were provided with a clear and detailed estimate right from the beginning. What impressed us the most was how the workers left the property perfectly cleaned each day and how the project was completed within the expected time frame. I highly recommend them.",

Jeison helped us with the insurance claim and to our surprise, not only did our insurance adjuster approve the claim, it was determined that our roof wasn't up to code. Jeison communicated with us throughout the entire process. He was always available to answer any questions or concern I had via text or phone. We are scheduled to have solar panels installed, but the new roof looks so nice I decided to cancel the solar so I can enjoy my beautiful roof, which compliments the color of my house very nicely. G A Castro Construction is great! I highly recommend them.",

        "description": "I have used G.A Castro for years. They are great if you need a new roof, roof repairs, cleaning/treating, exterior/interior carpentry/repairs, and more! I bought a house with a roof that requires regular repair. It wasn’t installed properly and not easy to fix. They magically fix sections as they become problematic, which most roofers would upsell you. But they do it because they want to do what is best for the client. Not create huge projects when things can be repaired. I have used Jason, German, and company twice a year to come inspect and repair sections of my roof (to prolong its longevity). I have also used them to treat/clean my roof. I’m shocked at how brand new it looks and they do it gently/with care. Their work is excellent/detailed and their pricing is very good. They also replaced/painted all of the trim and fascia on the exterior of my house, as well as many interior projects (repairing walls where I had a leak, painting (to perfection!!!), carpentry, chimney repair, cabinet updates, and power washing. They are really good/kind people. They are honest and I rely on them to do the hard stuff that comes with maintaining a home! Thankful for them!!",

He replaced all the Rottenwood and then put up vinyl siding to make my garage look new. I was so happy with the work that he and his men did they were at my house Early every morning and stayed well into the night till they got their days work done all his men were respectable and took care of my property as if it was their own when the work was done, they swept up and cleaned my yard as if they were never there . I would highly recommend Jeison and his workers to anyone that needs any kind of construction work. His prices are reasonable and fair and he understood my situation as a single senior citizen. He is truly a good guy."
